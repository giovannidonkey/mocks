LET CONST EXERCISE

1.// var can be reassigned and redeclared, while let can only reassign. Also, vars can use hoisted variables.

2.// const is declared once and cannot change and var can reassigned and redeclared.

3.// let can be reassigned and const cannot.

4.// Hoisting is how the compiler pulls vars before running the rest of the code, so that these variables will 
	be undefined until further notice.
